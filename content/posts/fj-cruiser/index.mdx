After being a one-car family for years in Dallas, TX I decided to buy my dream car after moving to Oregon. I did lots of research, shopped multiple sources, went on many test drives, and waited until I found exactly what I wanted, for the price I wanted.

I settled on a 2014 FJ Cruiser and, a year and a half later, I still absolutely love my FJ Cruiser. It is the perfect adventure vehicle, capable of handling mud, sand, snow, and any other off-road terrain I throw at it. This means I’ve been able to explore the forest, beach and mountain.

There are a few cons, like the terrible gas mileage, but working from home that hasn’t been an issue for me. Aside from short trips to run errands, usually less than 10 miles, the FJ is used to explore the great outdoors.

The FJ had about 32,000 miles on it when I bought it and is coming up on 50,000. Talking to other FJ Cruiser owners I will easily get to 100,000 miles with some reporting 200,000 miles and more without issues (given routine maintenance). The resale value is also fantastic.

> NADA Used Car Guide data said a base, typically equipped 2012 FJ Cruiser, which had a sticker price of $27,840, had an average trade-in price of $25,275 from August through October 2015 representing 90.8 percent of its sticker price.

I typically view cars as a giant cost, and the FJ is definitely an expense, but knowing I’ll be able to sell it for 90% of what I bought it for, even after adding tens of thousands of miles and time to the rig, is a good feeling.

Lastly, it has been a great way to meet people. The off-roading community is thriving and friendly. FJ Cruiser owners in the Pacific Northwest often get together. The dunes trip I went on in March 2018 was probably the most memorable so far but I am looking forward to more adventures in the future.
