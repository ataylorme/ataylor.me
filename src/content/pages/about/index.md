## I am...
* an Oregon native and Pacific Northwest fanatic
* an Agency and Community Engineer at [Pantheon](https://pantheon.io/)
* a full-stack web engineer versed in WordPress, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and more
* always keeping my skills up to date with emerging technology
* an avid homebrewer and craft beer lover

When I am not at the computer I like to spend my time with family, reading, outdoors (hiking, camping, fishing and mountain biking) and staying active (weight lifting, running and basketball).
